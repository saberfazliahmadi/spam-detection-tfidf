# üìß Spam Detection Using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and TF-IDF

## üìÄ Overview
This project delivers a **robust spam detection framework** that leverages **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** for text feature extraction and employs **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree Classifiers** for message classification. The model is evaluated on two datasets‚Äî**SMS Spam Collection** and **Enron Spam Dataset**‚Äîto ensure generalizability across different data sources. With advanced preprocessing, cross-dataset evaluation, and insightful visualizations, this project achieves high accuracy while offering a clear path for further improvement.

## üìö Methodology
### 1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - **Lowercasing**: Ensures uniformity by converting all text to lowercase.
   - **Tokenization**: Breaks sentences into individual words.
   - **Stop-word Removal**: Removes common but irrelevant words (e.g., "and," "the").
   - **Punctuation Removal**: Cleans special characters to focus on meaningful words.
### 2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - **TF-IDF Vectorization**:
     - Assigns a weight to each word based on its importance in the message and across the dataset.
     - Captures both term frequency (importance within a message) and inverse document frequency (rarity across the dataset).
### 3. **Classification Models**:
   - **Logistic Regression**:
     - A linear model for establishing baseline performance.
     - Efficient and interpretable.
   - **Decision Tree Classifier**:
     - A non-parametric model tuned for depth and split criteria using **Grid Search**.
     - Balances underfitting and overfitting by analyzing tree depth.
### 4. **Cross-Dataset Evaluation**:
   - Trains on one dataset (e.g., Enron) and evaluates on another (e.g., SMS Spam Collection) to assess generalizability.
