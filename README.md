# üìß Spam Detection Using Decision Tree and TF-IDF  

## üìå Overview  
This project showcases a **text classification pipeline** to detect spam messages by combining **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** for feature extraction with a **Decision Tree Classifier** for prediction. The goal is to preprocess raw text data, extract meaningful features, and classify messages as either **spam** or **ham** (non-spam).

## üöÄ Key Features  
- **Comprehensive Text Preprocessing**:  
  - Tokenization  
  - Stop-word removal  
  - Punctuation removal  
  - TF-IDF vectorization  
- **Efficient Classification**:  
  - Decision Tree model with adjustable depth to handle overfitting and underfitting.  
- **Detailed Evaluation**:  
  - Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.  
- **Visual Insights**:  
  - Graphs showing the effect of tree depth on classification accuracy.

### Step 3: Run the Jupyter Notebook  
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook  
   ```  
2. Open `notebook.ipynb` and execute the cells step by step to:

## üìä Results  
The Decision Tree Classifier was optimized by analyzing various tree depths to achieve a balance between training and testing performance.  

### Key Findings  
- **Optimal Tree Depth**: `20`  
- **Test Accuracy**: `96.50%`  

The optimal depth provided the highest accuracy while minimizing overfitting. Detailed graphs in the notebook illustrate the relationship between tree depth and classification accuracy.
