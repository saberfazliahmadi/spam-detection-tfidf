# 📧 Spam Detection Using Decision Tree and TF-IDF  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a robust **text classification pipeline** to detect spam messages using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** for feature extraction and a **Decision Tree Classifier** for prediction. The primary objective is to preprocess text data, extract meaningful features, and classify messages as either **spam** or **ham** (non-spam).

## 🚀 Key Features  
- **Comprehensive Text Preprocessing**:
  - Tokenization  
  - Stop-word removal  
  - Punctuation removal  
  - TF-IDF vectorization  
- **Efficient Classification**:
  - Decision Tree model with adjustable depth to analyze overfitting and underfitting behavior.  
- **Detailed Evaluation**:
  - Performance metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.  
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Graphs illustrating the impact of tree depth on classification accuracy.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository  
Clone this repository to your local system:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-detection-tfidf.git  
cd spam-detection-tfidf  
```  

### Step 2: Download the Dataset  
Download the **SMS Spam Collection** dataset and place it in the `dataset/` directory.  

### Step 3: Run the Jupyter Notebook  
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook  
   ```  
2. Open `notebook.ipynb` and execute cells sequentially to:

## 📊 Results  
The Decision Tree Classifier was optimized by analyzing different tree depths to strike a balance between training and testing performance.  

### Key Findings:  
- **Optimal Depth**: `X` *(replace with actual value)*  
- **Accuracy**: `XX.XX%` *(replace with achieved accuracy)*  

Detailed graphs included in the notebook demonstrate the relationship between tree depth and model accuracy.
