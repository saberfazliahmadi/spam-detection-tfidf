# 📊 Visualizations for Spam Detection Project

This folder contains visualizations and graphs generated during the implementation and analysis of the **Spam Detection Using Decision Tree and TF-IDF** project.

## 📈 Contents

1. **Effect_of_Tree_Depth_on_Accuracy_1_100.jpg**  
   - **Description**: This graph illustrates the effect of varying tree depths (from 1 to 100) on the model's accuracy. It demonstrates the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting as the tree depth increases.

2. **Tree_Depth_vs_Accuracy.jpg**  
   - **Description**: This graph provides a more focused view of the relationship between tree depth and model accuracy, highlighting the optimal depth that achieves the highest performance.

## 📁 Usage

These visualizations are referenced in the main project documentation and Jupyter notebook to support the analysis of the Decision Tree Classifier's performance.
